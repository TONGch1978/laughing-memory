This extension will surround YouTube videos with ambient light inside your browser. No need for extra hardware like lightstrips or smart lights like ambilight, it's all in your browser!


Requirement:

A video card with a score of at least 5000 points in the PassMark G3D Mark benchmark is recommended.
Check your video card's score here: https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu_list.php
With a score lower than 5000 the extension will still work but it is likely that the YouTube video page will be slow and/or stuttering.
